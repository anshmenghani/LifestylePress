						<p>Humans have engaged in drug usage for thousands of years, with opium poppies and cannabis leaves being easily accessible to humans of the Stone Age. But over the recent years of American society there has been great contention as to the usage of certain drugs. One example of this can be seen in the 18th and 21st amendments which illegalized and relegalized the creation, transportation, and sale of alcohol; respectively. A similar disagreement can be seen in the 21st century with the mass legalization of marijuana across American states. Some states like Oregon have made the even more radical decision to decriminalize the possession of small amounts of hard drugs such as fentanyl and cocaine (which has ended as of Sep 1, 2024). However, other states like South Carolina haven’t even legalized weed, much less other harder substances. But is this the right call? On one hand drug usage can be viewed as an extremely destructive -  activity, killing and destroying thousands of Americans’ lives every year. But on the other hand, the criminalization of hard drugs can be viewed as not only unnecessary, but dangerous towards the victims of substance abuse. With North Carolina starting to take steps to decriminalize the usage of marijuana over recent years, many questions are brought up. Specifically, should North Carolina implement more strict law enforcement of drug possession?						</p>
						<p>As a citizen of North Carolina, this is the question I plan to answer. It’s saddening to see people suffer at the expense of their drug addictions. In that sense, it does make sense for drug possession to be a punishable offense. But on the other hand it’s frustrating when punishments are given to the victims of their own addiction. What more punishment is necessary? I set out on this journey with a rudimentary understanding of the subject. But through my investigation I’ve learned the intricacies of drug laws and how they affect drug users through scientific articles, news sources, and interviews. And the inevitable conclusion to this newfound knowledge is that less strict law enforcement of drug possession should be implemented in North Carolina. Specifically, certain drugs should be decriminalized and the punishments for drug possession should be reduced. Why? Well let’s delve into the mixture of philosophical musings and empirical evidence that support this conclusion.
						</p>
						<p>Currently, North Carolina classifies drugs into 6 different categories. The most mild are schedule VI drugs, which include substances such as marijuana. But the jail time for possessing a schedule VI drug can vary anywhere from 30 days via misdemeanor to 5 years via felony based on the quantity. The most extreme drugs are schedule I drugs, which include substances like heroin and LSD. Possession of any of these drugs will result in 5 years of prison via felony.
						</p>
						<blockquote>“When a man gets robbed, who should be punished?” Will asked me on our phone call.</blockquote>
						<p>William Johnson, the COO of HS Drug & Alcohol Recovery Rehabilitation Center (“HS Drug & Alcohol Recovery Rehabilitation Center”), is a wise man when it comes to the effects of drug usage, having many years of on-field experience. “The robber of course,” I replied. His line of reasoning follows:
							The robber’s victim and the drug user aren’t a 1:1 comparison. For instance, the drug user willingly participates in the action they are commiting, unlike the robber’s victim. But there is still one key comparable aspect between the two: they are both victims. However in today’s society, these victims are treated very differently. Nobody in their right mind would punish someone for being robbed.
							</p>
						<p>Will made a good point. But why not punish the robber’s victim? After all, if you punish them you’re incentivising them to avoid being robbed. Perhaps they may be more cautious: avoiding dark alleys and leaving jewelry at home. While absurd, I realized that this is the exact type of logic that is used against drug users. If owning drugs is illegal then people won’t own drugs. But it is important to distinguish idealism and pragmatism. Yes, in a perfect world making drugs illegal should result in nobody owning them. But this is not reality. In reality, people are going to break laws anyways. So while it might seem tempting to punish the victims of drug abuse, the reality is that punishment won’t help. To not punish victims is not only common judgement in a philosophical sense, but it is supported by the data as well.
						</p>
						<p>One of the most damning studies that I came across during my time researching this subject was a study abstract by the International Journal of Drug Policy (Peterson). In the study, 40 opioid users were interviewed on their opinions regarding homicide laws aimed at reducing fentanyl distribution - specifically laws that increase sentence time for people charged with the distribution of fentanyl. The findings revealed that the interviewees did not believe that these laws would help to fix the overdose crisis. Common reasons they listed were the independence of drug users, risks of mass incarceration (1), the lack of intention for homicide, potential increases in violence (2), and the avoiding of calling 911.
						</p>
						<p>1: less strict law enforcement of drug laws will lead to less incarceration. Mass incarceration might seem like a good idea to prevent fentanyl distributors from commiting crime, but it actually sets them up to commit more crime. By giving them a criminal record, they are forced into a criminal identity. They will have trouble getting a job and will be treated as subhuman once they finish their sentence and are reintegrated into society. This will lead to them struggling to fit into society by lawful means. But it doesn’t lead to them struggling to fit into society by unlawful means. As the Looking-Glass Self theory states, an individual will base themselves on how they think that others perceive them - e.g. if you call someone a drug dealer, they will start dealing drugs. If anything, incarceration just encourages them to distribute fentanyl, causing more crime.</p>
						<p>2: Less strict law enforcement of drug laws will lead to less violence. This is because the American prison systems are a violent place that breeds gang-related activities, homicide, and other violent crimes. This type of violence is obviously unlawful.
						</p>
						<p>This demonstrates that increases in violence lead to increases in crime. And more broadly, less strict law enforcement of drug laws leads to less incarceration and violence, which leads to less crime.
							It has also been proven that there is absolutely no correlation between drug imprisonment rates, drug arrest rates, drug overdose death rates, and drug use rates (Brady) - something that Will emphasized in our conversation which I found out to be true. I understand why it might seem that arresting criminals is the solution. Afterall, it is a simple answer and humans are attracted to simple answers. But arrests are not only life-ruining, but costly to the taxpayers. In America, we should absolutely not violate anybody's right to sovereignty unless absolutely necessary. The fact that harsher drug possession laws aren't associated with better results goes to prove that the laws should be laxed.
							</p>
						<p>It’s great and all to cry out to the sky in outrage against unjust systems, but that doesn’t help the situation at hand. To fix this issue, I not only encourage North Carolina citizens, but politicians especially to deeply consider the effects that drug possession laws have on drug users, the people around them, and the citizens of North Carolina as a whole, in order to reach their own conclusion. Do your own research and look at other sources. I truly believe that the more people learn about this topic, the more likely it is that they will reach the same conclusion that I have. And once you reach your conclusion, I ask you to consider the following changes:
						</p>
						<p>All forms of marijuana should be legalized (eliminate schedule VI drug possession charges). Based on the scientific evidence available, marijuana is less dangerous than alcohol. While according to the National Library of Medicine, both drugs are associated with lower intelligence (Grønkjær and Power), Health-related costs are $165 for alcohol users per year, but $20 for marijuana users per year (O’Keefe). Marijuana overdoses can also not be fatal (Staff), unlike alcohol overdoses. And in the United States, 25-30% of violent crimes are the result of alcohol (O’Keefe), whereas marijuana is notoriously used as a drug for relaxation. Now this is not to say that alcohol should be banned. Of course, people should have the right to make their own decisions in regards to what they want to consume to a certain degree. And the 18th amendment (prohibited the production, transport and sale of alcohol) has proven to be one of the greatest failures of American lawmaking, as Will pointed out to me. But it is to say that it doesn’t make sense for alcohol to be legal but for marijuana to be illegal. And since alcohol should stay legal, as only 18% of Americans supported the illegalization of alcohol (“Americans and the Future of Cigarettes, Marijuana, Alcohol”), the most logical way to resolve this moral conundrum is to legalize marijuana. And the legalization of marijuana would greatly help to supervise against the admixture of other, more dangerous substances (like fentanyl), within marijuana, making it safe for drug users. Not to mention the other crimes that are associated with the illegal sale of drugs. Or even the taxpayer money required to enforce laws against marijuana possession as well as the fact that legalizing marijuana would lead to the establishment and prospering of an entire new industry in North Carolina, expanding our economy.
						</p>
						<p>Anabolic steroids should be reclassified as a schedule V drug. It's paradoxical for those seeking to become physically stronger to be treated the same as people who suffer from drug addictions that use drugs for typically recreational purposes. Although using steroids can certainly be just as harmful to a person’s health as other schedule III drugs, any drug can be taken in a quantity so it is just as harmful as another drug. And steroids are generally taken in reasonable doses and are not enforced with nearly the same intensity as other schedule III drugs anyways.
							No drug possession conviction should be a felony. Felonies should be reserved for the most serious of crimes, such as rape, robbery, or murder. It doesn’t make sense to punish someone to that same degree over an action who they themselves are the direct victim of.
							</p>
						<p>No drug possession conviction should result in a fine. Drug addictions often “disproportionately affect lower-income and minority communities,” as Will put it. People convicted of drug possession often struggle to pay fines and fines do little to actually rehabilitate the victim in any meaningful way, instead simply adding onto the pressures that may have driven them to pick their habit up in the first place.
							Schedule IV drug possession maximum penalties should be reduced. Schedule IV drugs are considerably less dangerous than schedule III drugs. Yet they have the same maximum penalties. This discrepancy should be solved by reducing schedule IV drug possession maximum penalties so that they are between schedule III and schedule V drugs in terms of severity.
							Prison times should be reduced across all schedules of drugs. Prison is a punishment, but what people convicted of drug possession need is rehabilitation. Prison time is actually an important aspect of discipline that is required to deter these criminal activities. But the current punishments are excessive and do more to hurt those charged with drug possession than to rehabilitate them, something that Will is adamant on.

						<p>	In summary, penalties for drug possession should be decreased due to the immorality of the current punishments, the infectivity of drug imprisonment,  and discrepancies in the current punishments. Although all of these changes might not be in line with your personal view, or even possible to achieve in the first place, I am extremely grateful to any politicians who have dedicated any more thought towards this matter because they read this article. It would be a great step forwards, and I’d greatly encourage you to propose and support laws to achieve some, or all of the goals outlined in this article. And I encourage everyone to become educated on this topic and voice their opinion, at which point the utility of democracy will work reflexively to represent the true beliefs of the people.
